    <h1>How to Build Good Credit</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Building good credit is crucial for financial health. It opens doors to better loan terms, lower interest rates, and even 
      better opportunities in housing and employment. Responsible credit management involves consistent on-time payments, 
      keeping balances low, and a mix of credit types. Avoiding excessive debt and monitoring your credit report for errors 
      are also essential steps. Building a strong credit history takes time, but the long-term benefits are substantial.

    <ul>
      <li>Always pay your bills on time: Late payments negatively impact your credit score significantly.</li>
      <li>Keep your credit utilization low: Aim to use less than 30% of your available credit limit.</li>
      <li>Diversify your credit mix: Having different types of credit, like loans and credit cards, can be beneficial.</li>
    </ul>
